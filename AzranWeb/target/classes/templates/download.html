                <p class="lead mb-5 text-center text-light border-dark">Azran is a Screen Share (SS) tool used to scan a
                    player's computer &amp; running instance of Minecraft to detect various cheats/hacked clients they
                    could be using.
                    <br>
                    <br>It has features like:&nbsp;
                    <br>*It will notify you if a user has edited their recycle bin
                    <br>*It will notify you if the user has restarted explorer
                    <br>*It will notify you if any JNativeHook- files are found in %temp%
                    <br>*It will list all .exe files opened on that instance of windows for you, so for example you
                    could see something like Autoclicker.exe was opened after MinecraftLauncher.exe was opened
                    <br>*100% automatic scanning, so all you have to do is hit scan &amp; it does everything for you.
                    <br>*It scans for X-Ray
                    <br>*Along with the hundreds of specific detections we have for clients, we also have generalization
                    for both clients &amp; autoclickers to detect them without having specific strings. This also
                    applies to blatant clients, skidded clients, ghost
                    clients with a bad self destruct, etc. Tons of clients have overlapping detections so there's a
                    plethora of things we detect that we can't specify *Frequently updated &amp; adding new features
